# spell-table-plus
Spell Table Plus is a companion application to Wizards of the Coast's Spell Table.  While its great to be able to sling spells with your actual cards not everyone has a great set up that makes it easy to read the board state.  The point of Spell Table Plus is to have an easy way to represent your board state to your opponents so you can focus on swinging for lethal!
